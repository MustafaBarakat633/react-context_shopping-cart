# Simple shopping cart using _React Context_

This project is already implemented but with Prop Drilling problem. Here is [the repo](https://github.com/MustafaBarakat633/simple-shopping-cart-react.js).

The project is now updated and I used React Context.

React Context makes any data you want to share, state values or functions accessible directly through wrapped components by collecting these data and pass it as a value to the context provider component. Hence, this prevents Prop Drilling.
