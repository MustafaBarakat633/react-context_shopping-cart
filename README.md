# Simple shopping cart using _React Context_

This project is already implemented but with Prop Drilling problem. Here is [the repo](https://github.com/MustafaBarakat633/simple-shopping-cart-react.js).

The project is now updated and I used React Context.

React Context makes any data you want to share, state values or functions accessible directly through wrapped components by collecting these data and pass it as a value to the context provider component. Hence, this preventsÂ PropÂ Drilling.

## Adding _useReducer_ Hook:

### ðŸŒŸ Leveling Up in React: Discovering the Power of useReducer! ðŸŒŸ

Recently, I explored the useReducer hook in React and updated the project I mentioned in the previous post to use it. Itâ€™s been a game-changer for managing complex state logicâ€”like having a mini Redux built right into your components! ðŸš€

### Why choose useReducer over useState? ðŸ¤”

#### useState:

- Perfect for simple state management (e.g., toggles, counters).

- Quick and easy to set up for straightforward use cases.

#### useReducer:

- Ideal for complex state logic or scenarios involving multiple state transitions.

- Keeps your code organized by separating actions and reducer logic.

- Scales better for larger projects.

In my case, switching to useReducer made the codebase cleaner, easier to maintain, and more scalable.
